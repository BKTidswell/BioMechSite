			  	In this video you will see the model of the octopus' arm reaching for a target, a red dot below it.  The neural commands that guide its reaching motions come from a three-layer neural network that takes as input the position of the dot and outputs delays and activation times to each of the muscle-springs in the arm. This allows it to create all motor commands at once instead of fine-tuning as the arm moves closer to the point. While this is not a true model of how limbs are controlled, it simplifies the control algorithm, while still allowing different movements over time.

				For training data I created activations for the arm and then recorded where the tip of the arm ended up in the coordinate space. Initially I created random delays and activations to move the arm, but this created too noisy a dataset to train the neural network on. I then randomly generated one or two bend points in the arm, and then created delays and activations to bend the arm at those points to create a more ordered dataset to train the neural network on.
