			  	Muscular hydrostats are a unique type of limb, and one that many animals possess. These appendages lack any type of skeletal structure, but are still able to perform precise, controlled and varied movements. Most terrestrial vertebrate tongues are muscular hydrostats, as are elephant trunks, squid tentacles, and octopus arms. The traditional idea of locomotion relies on the interactions of muscles acting on skeletal systems, making muscular hydrostats an interesting exception. They work because water is incompressible under biological conditions, and since muscle tissue is primarily water, muscle is incompressible. This means it is possible for a muscular hydrostat to change its shape and orientation by contracting sets of muscles in antagonistic pairs<sup>1</sup>.

				Beyond being a different type of limb, muscular hydrostats are unique because they can move with nearly infinite degrees of freedom. They also have many applications in the realm of soft robotics, as they can be used on robots without requiring a hard support system<sup>1</sup>. This means that robots can be made without any hard parts, which would provide many benefits, such as allowing them into smaller spaces and allowing more degrees of freedom with movement.
