		  		Octopuses are amazing animals to study for many reasons. They have remarkable physiology, and a whole suite of interesting abilities, such as color changing, texture changing, jet propulsion, and the ability to see the polarization of light. They are an intelligent creature that is a massive evolutionary distance away from us. This intelligence is what makes them so remarkable, especially for a mollusc.<sup>4</sup><br><br>

				Of course, their relevance to this project is the fact that octopus arms are muscular hydrostats. They are able to expertly manipulate their own bodies and their environment with arms that have many degrees of freedom. In order to do this effectively, octopus have developed particular reaching patterns to reduce complexity.<sup>3</sup> This ability to control and coordinate all eight arms is further enabled by the fact that their central nervous system is decentralized: two-thirds of the nervous system's neurons are in the arms, organized into clusters called ganglia. <sup>4</sup><br><br>

				The difficulties and opportunities that come with having eight muscular hydrostats to control may be why octopus have evolved to be so intelligent. Their brains need to coordinate with eight arms that are controlled primarily by their own ganglia. This is done using a combination of localized and top down control, which octopus are able to do quite well.<sup>4</sup> They are expert problem solvers, to the point where it is difficult to keep them contained in tanks. The have also learned to short circuit lights with jets of water and can recognize people, often for the purpose of harassment.<sup>4</sup> Their literal and mental flexibility may be related, both developing as they evolved away from the protection of hard shells and needed to develop other tools to protect themselves.<sup>4</sup>
