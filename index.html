			  	This website was made to document and display the work done to model octopus arms for my biomechanics class at Vassar College. I have always been interested in octopuses because of the interesting way they move, their intelligence, and color changing abilities. This project focused on how they move without skeletal systems, using only muscular hydrostats. These The goal of this work was to create a model of an octopus arm and then train a neural network to control this arm to touch targets. The model itself was constructed based on work by Yekutieli et al on a 2D model of an octopus arm.

				In this website there is information about muscular hydrostats, octopuses, and work done to model octopus arms. Also included is a an interactive version of the model where you can try to control an octopus arm to touch targets yourself. Finally there is a description of the neural network created to control the arm model and a video of the results. <br><br> If you want to contact me, Ben Tidswell, about this project or anything related to it you can email me at b.k.tidswell@gmail.com.
